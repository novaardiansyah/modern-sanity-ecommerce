# Modern Sanity E-Commerce

Hi future, this is my project to build a web application for e-commerce purposes. This project was built using Next.js and Sanity.io. This project is still in the development stage, so there is still a lot to improve.

To fulfill my need for knowledge about Next.js and Sanity.io, I made this project, of course with the hope that it can help friends who want to build an e-commerce website with Next.js and Sanity.io.

We provide this feature-rich application for both you personally and your team to be used for free and also legally, get full access to the application along with all the dummy schemes and data needed to get started, although this application is completely free and can be freely used, you need to understand and comply that this "Modern Sanity E-Commerce" application is protected by the [MIT License](https://github.com/novaardiansyah/modern-sanity-ecommerce/blob/main/LICENSE) and all copyrights of the creator.

### How to Use

To view and use the app in the [Demo Mode](https://github.com/novaardiansyah/modern-sanity-ecommerce/) that is already available, you can try to log in to the system using several accounts with different level access.

We free you to make any changes in the system, we are happy to see you try all the facilities we provide, we only wish you the best, we also hope you are kind enough to leave an impression and message for us, so that we can get better in the future.

We challenge you to challenge us to create complementary features that are roughly suitable for the development of this application but we don't have them yet, we also challenge you to dare to report problems in the big issue if indeed it interferes with your comfort and security in our system.

Here is a list of accounts that we provide according to the existing access level, and are free for you to use:

- Super Administrator Access

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;username : superadmin <br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;password : 123456

- Administrator Access

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;username : admin <br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;password : 123456

- Operator Access

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;username : operator <br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;password : 123456

Oh yes, we forgot to tell you, that for customer-level access you only need to manually register into our system, have fun all, best regards - Nova.
